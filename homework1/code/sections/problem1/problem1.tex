\section{Developing RAW images}
In this problem, we will use the provided RAW image \texttt{Thayer.CR2} 
in order to implement a basic image processing pipeline.

\subsection{Implementing a basic image processing pipeline}

\subsubsection*{RAW image conversion}

Calling \texttt{dcraw -4 -d -v -w -T Thayer.CR2} 
converts the RAW image to a TIFF file without any color interpolation. 
We observe the CLI output:
\begin{Verbatim}[fontsize=\small]
    Loading Canon EOS 2000D image from Thayer.CR2 ...
    Scaling with darkness 2044, saturation 16383, and
    multipliers 2.165039 1.000000 1.643555 1.000000
    Building histograms...
    Writing data to Thayer.tiff ...
\end{Verbatim}
where our multipliers represent \texttt{<r\_scale> <g\_scale> <b\_scale> <g\_scale>},
and darkness and saturation represent the black and white levels, respectively.

\noindent We then call \texttt{dcraw -4 -D -T Thayer.CR2} to convert the RAW image to a TIFF file 
without any color interpolation or white balancing, obtaining a grayscale image that  
we will use for the remainder of the problem.
